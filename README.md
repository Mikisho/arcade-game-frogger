# Welcome to Arcade Game - Frogger


# **Project Overview**
This Classic Arcade Game Clone project was done for the full fillment of Udacity Front End WedbDeveloper NanoDegree program.

# **Basic Functionality**
The game has Player and Enemies (Bugs). The player has a goal to reach the water, without colliding into any one of the enemies. The player can move left,right,up and down. Eniems are tending to move in varying speeds on the paved block portion of the scene. If the player collides with an enemy, then, the game is reset and the player moves back to the start square. Once the player reaches the water the game is won.


## **Here are the rules:**
- Run index.html in your favorite browser
- Select a player
- When you are ready "Start new game"
- 30 seconds are allotted to you to collect as many items as possible
- You will score 10 points for each if you collect a heart, star or key
- Collect a gem (blue, green or orange) will give you 30 points each (but be aware: they disappear after a while)
- Collect a meteor will give you 50 points (but be aware: once it starts sliding down its gone)
- Be careful with the bugs! Avoid colliding with them or you loose all you points!!
- If you make to the water line you will get 20 points and can continue collecting more items.

GOOD LUCK!!
